# WatchBox, copied from SparseBox

## TEMPORARY BROKEN, STILL A PROOF OF CONCEPT.

Help pairing old iOS devices with new watchOS without jailbreaking/TrollStore or updating iOS.

- Take some code from [Lemin's file](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget-Mobile/blob/main/Nugget/Sparserestore/Restore.swift) (for HomeDomain stuff in CBL)

## Installation
SideStore is recommended as you will also be getting the pairing file and setting up VPN.

Download ipa from [here](https://github.com/34306/WatchBox/blob/main/packages/com.34306.watchbox_0.0.1-4+debug.ipa)

Before opening SparseBox, you have to close SideStore from app switcher. This is because only one app can use VPN proxy at a time. Maybe changing port could solve this issue.
